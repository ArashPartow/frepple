How can I detect purchase orders that need expediting?
======================================================

1) Navigate to Purchase Orders in the Purchasing menu.
2) Click on the Inventory Status column to sort the orders by inventory status ascending.
3) The cells in red need expediting. 
4) The safety stock of the item-location they replenish will be either partially or totally consumed in one lead time from current date.
