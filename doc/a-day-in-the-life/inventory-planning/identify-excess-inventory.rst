=========================================
Where can I find stock excess situations?
=========================================

1) Navigate to Inventory Report in the Inventory menu, or the Demand Report in the Sales menu.
2) Use the "period of cover" field to filter and/or sort by the excess.
   The "period of cover" is computed as the moment the last unit of your current inventory will be used up.
