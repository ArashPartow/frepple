How to approve a MO, a PO or a DO ?
===================================

- | Approving a manufacturing order, a distribution order or a purchase order means sending it to the ERP
  | for execution.
- | In the PO/MO/DO screen, the planner needs to filter for the records with a proposed status.
- | Indeed, records with a confirmed or approved status means that this MO/PO/DO is already in the ERP.
- | The planner needs to sort the records by ordering date (for POs), shipment date (for DOs) or start date (for MOs).
- | The planner needs to select the records to approve (i.e export to the ERP). Exporting records that don't have
  | an execution date pretty close in the future is not a good practice as frePPLe will continue to replan these records.
- | The planner needs to click on the "Export to ERP" button to create the records in the ERP.
- | Next time the interface will be run between the ERP and frePPLe, these records will be imported with a
  | confirmed status in frePPLe.
