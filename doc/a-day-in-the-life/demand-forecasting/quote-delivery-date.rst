How can I quote a delivery date for a new customer order?
=========================================================

A customer wants to place a new sales order, and asks you when you can deliver it.

ERP systems will typically quote the order with a fixed lead time for the item.

Frepple can do better. Its quoting web service dynamically verifies in the latest
plan when material and capacity are available to deliver the customer order.

This functionality is often called "capable to promise". It provides your sales
team an advanced tool to answer customer inquiries.

1) Navigate to the Quotes under the Sales menu.
2) Populate the required fields in the Quote Form.
3) Click on the inquiry button and check in the Operations widget the proposed end date corresponding to the first promise date for the sales order.
