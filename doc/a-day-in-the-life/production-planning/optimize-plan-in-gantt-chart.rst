How can I optimize my plan in the GANTT chart plan editor?
==========================================================

Navigate to Plan Editor in the Manufacturing menu and select an order on the GANTT chart.
From there, you can:

1) modify the start/end time of an order by dragging and dropping the block or editing dates in the Manufacturing Order widget.
2) Pick an alternate operation when possible.
3) Pick an alternate resource when possible.

Any of the above change will trigger a plan update, frePPLe will make sure that the plan remains feasible.
