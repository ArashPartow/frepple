Extension apps
==============

FrePPLe has a modular architecture. There are a number of core modules,
and also a number of optional apps that provide new functionality.

Extensions can be provided by the frepple team, the frepple user community
or `developed by yourself </developer-guid/creating-an-extension-app.html>`_.
